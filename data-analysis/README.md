# ðŸ“Š Data Analysis Projects

This folder contains my data analysis projects, focusing on text mining, preprocessing, and machine learning classification.  
The projects demonstrate practical implementation of data collection, cleaning, feature extraction, and algorithmic modeling.

## ðŸ”¹ Workflow Applied

1. **Data Scraping**  
   - Collected raw data from online platforms using tools such as **Google Colab, Python, and APIs**.  
   - Extracted datasets related to application reviews, social media text, or case-specific data.  

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Removed noise (duplicates, punctuation, stopwords).  
   - Conducted tokenization, case folding, and stemming/lemmatization.  
   - Ensured datasets were ready for analysis and model training.  

3. **Word Weighting (Feature Extraction)**  
   - Applied **TF-IDF (Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency)** for feature representation.  
   - Transformed text into numerical vectors suitable for classification.  

4. **Classification with NaÃ¯ve Bayes**  
   - Implemented **Multinomial NaÃ¯ve Bayes** for sentiment classification tasks.  
   - Conducted model training and testing.  
   - Evaluated results using **Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, and Recall**.

## ðŸ”¹ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK)  
- **Google Colab** for cloud-based execution  
- **RapidMiner** for comparative evaluation  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tableau
